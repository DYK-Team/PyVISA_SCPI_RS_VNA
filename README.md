This project provides a straightforward test setup for sending SCPI commands and managing S2P files between Python and a Rohde & Schwarz Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The approach demonstrates how to leverage Python's powerful libraries to automate and simplify communication with the VNA, making it easier to integrate into customized workflows for test and measurement setups.

Key Features:

  SCPI Command Integration: Automate VNA configuration and operation by sending SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) commands directly from Python.
  
  S2P File Handling: Streamline the process of retrieving and managing touchstone (S2P) files from the VNA for subsequent analysis or storage.
  
Python Libraries Used:

  PyVISA: Provides a Pythonic interface to VISA-compatible instruments, ensuring smooth communication with the VNA (https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
  
  RsInstrument: A high-level library specifically optimized for Rohde & Schwarz instruments, offering intuitive command handling and additional functionality   (https://pypi.org/project/RsInstrument/).
  
Benefits of This Approach:

  Automation: Minimize manual intervention by automating repetitive tasks such as instrument configuration and data retrieval.
  
  Flexibility: Python's extensive library ecosystem allows integration with data processing, visualization, and storage workflows.
  
  Ease of Use: Combining PyVISA and RsInstrument simplifies the complexities of SCPI command structures and enhances script readability.
